# Lotto Simulator

## User Preferences

- Make tool decisions autonomously without asking yes/no confirmation
- Proceed with actions directly, don't ask for permission


## ?? MANDATORY: CI/CD Monitoring

**ALWAYS check GitHub Actions after ANY push.** This is non-negotiable.

### After Every `git push`:

```bash
gh run list --limit 3  # Check workflow status
```

### If ANY workflow fails:

1. **STOP** all other work immediately
2. Run `gh run view <id> --log-failed` to see the error
3. **Fix the failure** before continuing
4. Push the fix and verify CI passes

### Never:
- Ignore failing workflows
- Continue coding while CI is red
- Deploy with failed checks

**CI failures are P0 blockers. Period.**

## Mandatory UI Verification

**ALWAYS verify the application is working after ANY code changes.**

### After Every Code Change:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test UI loads at http://localhost:5173 (or configured port)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test simulation functionality

**Do NOT consider a task complete until verification passes.**

## Pre-Deployment Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY deployment, the following steps MUST complete successfully:**

### Step 1: Stage, Commit, and Push

```bash
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "[type]: [description]"
git push origin [branch]
```

### Step 2: Monitor GitHub Actions

```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Watch active run until completion
gh run watch [run-id]

# Check for failures
gh run list --status failure --limit 10
```

### Step 3: Handle Failed Workflows

**If any workflow fails:**

1. View failure details: `gh run view [run-id] --log-failed`
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix the issue
4. Commit and push fix
5. Rerun failed jobs: `gh run rerun [run-id] --failed`
6. Monitor until passing

### Step 4: Investigate and Resolve ALL Failed/Cancelled Runs

**⚠️ MANDATORY: You MUST investigate every failed and cancelled run before proceeding.**

A new passing run does NOT clear old failures. You cannot proceed until every failed/cancelled run has been investigated and either FIXED or REMOVED.

**FIRST: List all failed and cancelled runs:**
```bash
# Get ALL failed runs
gh run list --status failure --limit 50 --json databaseId,workflowName,headSha,createdAt,conclusion

# Get ALL cancelled runs  
gh run list --status cancelled --limit 50 --json databaseId,workflowName,headSha,createdAt,conclusion
```

**THEN: For EACH failed/cancelled run, you MUST investigate:**
```bash
# 1. View the run details
gh run view [run-id]

# 2. For failures - see what went wrong
gh run view [run-id] --log-failed

# 3. Check which commit triggered it
gh run view [run-id] --json headSha -q '.headSha'
```

**AFTER investigating, choose ONE resolution:**

| Resolution | When to Use | Action Required |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **FIX** | Issue still exists in current code | Fix the code, push, verify new run passes |
| **RERUN** | Flaky test / transient failure | `gh run rerun [run-id]` and watch until passes |
| **DELETE** | Obsolete (old branch, superseded commit, abandoned work) | `gh run delete [run-id]` |
| **DOCUMENT** | Cannot fix now but acknowledged | Add to technical debt log with issue number |

**Resolution workflow:**
```bash
# Option A: Delete obsolete runs (old commits that have been superseded)
gh run delete [run-id]

# Option B: Rerun if it was a transient failure
gh run rerun [run-id]
gh run watch [run-id]

# Option C: Fix the issue
# 1. Fix code
# 2. git add -A && git commit -m "fix: [description]" && git push
# 3. gh run watch [new-run-id]
```

**VERIFICATION - Run this and it MUST return empty arrays:**
```bash
echo "=== Failed runs (must be empty) ===" 
gh run list --status failure --limit 50 --json databaseId,workflowName
echo "=== Cancelled runs (must be empty) ==="
gh run list --status cancelled --limit 50 --json databaseId,workflowName
```

**❌ NEVER do this:**
- Skip investigating a failed/cancelled run
- Push new commits hoping old failures "disappear"
- Ignore red/yellow runs because a newer green run exists
- Assume failures are "flaky" without running `gh run view --log-failed`
- Proceed while ANY unresolved failed/cancelled runs exist
### Step 5: Deployment Gate Check

**HARD BLOCK**: Deployment cannot proceed if:

- Any current workflow is failing
- Unreviewed past failures exist
- Critical/High security issues unresolved

**Note**: CI/CD is a HARD BLOCK (not scored) - deployment cannot proceed with failed workflows.
